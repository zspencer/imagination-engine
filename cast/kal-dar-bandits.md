## The Kal-dar "Bandits", Refuges from the Northern realm of Kal.
**Base**: Camp at 0,3
**Refugees from the far north.**

Driven from their homes, the Kal-dar have journeyed for months, traveling south.
They're unsure what to do or where to go; now that they have reached the ocean.

A not particularly cunning or able lot, the Kal-Dar are former shop-keeps and
tradesfolk who were on the wrong side of a revolution. They lack most survival
skills.

Out of desperation, they've resorted to raiding Del for food every four days.

### Inventory

1 potion for curing of illness and elimination poison.

### Fes, The Megalomaniac; Seeker of Power (4/2)

Fes wears light hide armor over a brown tunic and wields a two-handed
long-sword; with a beautiful hilt hidden beneath a wrapping of leather.

Fes is particularly distrustful, and as the de-facto "leader" of the Kal-dar
tends to be gruff and overly protective.

Fes dreams of one-day returning home; and becoming ruler of all of Kal.

### Earl, The Thief; Seeker of Order (4/2)

Earl wears a loose-fitting, light grey tunic kept near-spotless. Earl doesn't
carry any visible weapons, but a keen observer may notice the small knife
strapped to their forearm. An even keener observer would notice the one in their
boot.

Preferring subterfuge over direct force; Earl is adept at picking locks.

Earl just wants to be happy and safe, but sticks around to take care of Fes.

### Ben the Wrafthul; Seeker of Justice (2/1)

Ben wields a short sword and wears a tattered yellow tunic.

Ben is quite displeased with the way things all went down. Angry, unsure and
displeased; Ben follows Fes out of a hope to achieve some form of justice for
their suffering.

Ben's old shop was an antique jewelry.

### Eye the Fearful; Seeker of Compassion (2/1)

Eye carries a short-bow, and wears a tattered blue tunic with grubby brown
pants.

Eye wants everyone to get along, and is terrified of being left behind or alone.
