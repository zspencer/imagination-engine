### Fes, The Megalomaniac; Seeker of Power (4/2)

Fes wears light hide armor over a brown tunic and wields a two-handed
long-sword; with a beautiful hilt hidden beneath a wrapping of leather.

Fel is particularly distrustful, and as the de-facto "leader" of the Kal-dar
tends to be gruff and overly protective.

Fes dreams of one-day returning home; and becoming ruler of all of Kal.
