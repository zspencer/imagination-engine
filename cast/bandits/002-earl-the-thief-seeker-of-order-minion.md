### Earl, The thief; seeker of order (4/2)

Earl wears a loose-fitting, light grey tunic kept near-spotless. Earl doesn't
carry any visible weapons, but a keen observer may notice the small knife
strapped to their forearm. An even keener observer would notice the one in their
boot.

Preferring subterfuge over direct force; Earl is adept at picking locks.

Earl just wants to be happy and safe, but sticks around to take care of Fes.
