## The Kal-dar "Bandits", Refuges from the Northern realm of Kal.
**Base**: Camp at 0,3
**Refugees from the far north.**

Driven from their homes, the Kal-dar have journeyed for months, traveling south.
They're unsure what to do or where to go; now that they have reached the ocean.

A not particularly cunning or able lot, the Kal-Dar are former shop-keeps and
tradesfolk who were on the wrong side of a revolution. They lack most survival
skills.

Out of desperation, they've resorted to raiding Del for food every four days.
