## Session 1 (Growing Season, First of Ahn, Early-Afternoon, Clear Weather)

The bright sunlight beats down on Thelonious LaCroix as he lies sprawled out on
the beach. He doesn't quite know how he got here, nor where here really even is.
The last thing Thelonious LaCroix _does_ remember is... well... Nothing?

Thelonious LaCroix awoke on the beach, and startled away a Burmut. He attempted
to blaze a trail through the forest. His spear got caught in some vines; so he
returned to the existinng trail and headed north.

He arrived at a small town, where there was a heated discussion between Ee and
Arn arguing about what to do with the bandits that are taking their food.

Thelonious convinces Ee to set up a barricade. Arn convinces Thelonious to
negotiate before fighting.

Thelonious knows that a storm is brewing, and heads West along the road. After a
little ways, he notices some brush that has been damaged, and heads south.

He finds a Burmut, who he feeds and makes his Animal Partner, Felt.

As he emerges from the forest, He shouts out a phrase "It's raining cats and
dogs" and steps out of the woods.

Earl is suspicious, but Eye tells Earl to calm down. Thelonious asks Eye who the
leader is, and Eye points to Fes. He asks what people have been talking about
lately, and is told that there is some discussion about whether they stay here
or move on.

Thelonious asks Fes if anything unusual has been happening. No. Thelonious asks
if they've been stealing food; Fes responds "we gotta eat."

Thelonious suggests that he can teach them how to get food from other means, Fes
rejects that premise, and Thelonious stomps off and returns to the town.

The wind continues to pick up, and a light rain begins.
We paused with Thelonious just outside town (2,1); with the storm brewing and
the Bandits an hour away.

## Session 2 (Growing Season, First of Ahn, Late-Afternoon, Storm Brewing)

Thelonios tried to convince Ee that the barricade was too weak, and also unnecessrary.
Then got fed up and walked along the road to meet the bandits.

Thelonios gave them your Remedy potion, and convinced them that you would bring
them food tomorrow. Gathered some edible roots and berries and such from the
forest; then slept over night in your Tent in a Tin

### Second of Ahn

Hunted a Grank that had gotten startled when you took back your tent; and then
started walking back to the bandits. You were stalked by a pack of Dirden, which
attempted to steal the Grank from you, but failed; as you were able to
successfully defend yourself thanks to Felt.

You walk back, and hear the argument between Fes and Earl, where Fes wanted to
go in hard and get the food; while Earl wanted to sneak to steal it to avoid
conflict.

You showed them that you brought them a Grank and some of the forage; and
offered to teach them how they could fend for themselves off the land. They
agreed because you had earned their trust by bringing them food.

Pause (no rest)

## Session 3 (Growing Season, Second of Ahn, Early Evening, Cloudy Weather)

Cooked the Grank, talked with Eye about why they were raiding; learned that the
Duke of Kal had taken their stores and fields and turned them into a barracks.

Tried to convince Fes and Earl not to go back and fight, but failed.

### (Growing Season, Third of Ahn, Early Morning, Clear Weather)

Felt Befriends Ben, and learns that Fes is interested in heading back North.

LaCroix makes a pie for Fes and Ben, and it makes Ben think LaCroix is
incompetent. Fes agrees to head north, but wants to figure out how to survive
the journey.

LaCroix heads north, and tries to find breakfast for Felt; and is attacked by 3
Culdinaries. This is unusual for them.

LaCroix found DabblingWaka traks, and followed them to 4,4 where they meet Daw.
Daw tells them that the woods started getting a bit more violent a few months
ago. LaCroix invites Daw to go for a walk in the woods. They walk north, and are
jumped by some Ablegriks.

Daw transforms into a Dabblinwakka, and is bit through the skin by the Ablegrik.

LaCroix performs a new technique, shooting two arrows at once. Gets bit by an
Ablegrik, which Felt pulls off of LaCroix.

Daw uses a magical spell to amplify a ROAR that terrifies the two remaining
Ablegriks, who flee.

LaCroix walks Daw back to their hut, and learns about some of the calls of the
animals in the region.

Pitched the tent in the backyard, and took a long rest.

Meanwhile, the Kal-dar have attemped to sneakily rob the village.

## Session 4 (Fourth of Ahn, Early Morning, Slightly Foggy Weather)

After breakfast with Daw, LaCroix heads to the Kal'Dar camp down south.

There was no one around, so LaCroix waited for a couple hours.

About an hour later, laCroix heard voices; and emerged to hail them.

LaCroix reiterated that the Kal-Dar should not steal from or attack towns; which
angered Fes. Fes declared that no one gets to tell them what to do, since
they're the boss and attacked LaCroix.

During the battle, Fes was hurt slightly; but LaCroix managed to wear Fes down
by using a double arrow and then berating them for not eating well enough.

They returned to the camp, where Lacroix offered Fes some tea with a remedy, but
Fes refused it and then threw the bottle of Remedy in the brush.

### Fourth of Ahn, (Early Afternoon, Clear Weather)

After tea, Thelonius apologized for hurting Fes.

They walked to Daw's cabin. Daw had a Biddlenut in their hut, which was making
some trouble. Daw told them there are berries and nuts all around. Thelonious
encourages them to find Berries first.

Eye finds some berries, and follows Thelonious instructions ot touch them first
to their arm, then their lips, then their tongue to see if they're safe. But Eye
eats them before waiting too long.

Thelonious asks Daw where to find nuts, and Daw hits a tree with their walking
stick, and catches a nut as it falls from the tree. Thelonious encourages the
group to put out their tunics and hit the trees with their weapons; but not many
nuts are found.

From there, Thelonious asks Daw where other nuts may be, and Daw shows them a
bush with enough nuts for a half a day of food.

They gather those nuts, and then Thelonious tells them to begin turning over
rocks to expose Culdinary. Eye and Earl flip some rocks, but both Eye and Earl
fail to bring down their targets.

Fes and Ben manage to uncover a couple more. Thelonious shoots one to
demonstrate how to make a quick, clean kill. Ben then chases down and bludgeons
a Culdinary to death with their short sword; quite ungracefully.

Daw agrees to teach them how to cook what they've gathered and hunted.

End at 4,5

## Session 5 (Fifth of Ahn, Early Morning, Clear)

The forest is bustling and active; it forest smells damp, with the morning dew. 

Thel greets Fes who is the only kal-dar awake. Thel shows Fes how to make a bed
from grass and reeds.

Thel catches Fes' eyes and uses Soulgaze to learn that Fez's is a seeker of
Power, and they are cowardly.

The rest of the camp begins to awake, with Daw remaining a little bit asleep.

Thel carves a piece of walnut wood icon while waiting for Felt to awake.

Thel feeds Felt some berries by rolling them about the tent for play. Thel uses
Speak with Animal on Felt.

Felt shares that the north has smelt both scary and interesting. A sickly
sweatness, like something just beginning to rot and it's gotten worse.

Thel wakes Daw, and offers to make tea. They sanitize some nearby cups from last
night, and brew some tea.

Thel asks Daw about the rotting smell. Daw shares that the Dark Druids came
years ago, and began to absorb the life from the creaures of the forest. Daw has
been keeping the people of Del safe by bringing the forest back to harmony.

The forest is brought into harmony by noticing when things are out of balance.

Earl is showing Eye and Ben how to use their weapons. Fes is watching and
simmering a bit.

Thel asks Earl what they think about the dark druids and disharmony. Earl
responded nonchalantly. Thel asks how Earl got to Del; and Earl shares that they
came from the West, through Oon.

Thel throws their tent in a  tin into the air to capture everyones attention and
announces their intent to teach survival by going through the heart of the
forest.

Fes, angrily retorts that they avoided the forest heading down because of how it
is cursed.

Thel replies that it could make the group strongest, and that it bothers them as
a ranger; and may even be something connected to their city.

But Thel leaves it to Fes to decide.

Fes agrees, and Thel makes a Culdinary Bacon and Wild bird eggs for a forest
brunch and berries for Sangria.

"Every honorable journey starts with a good meal and a Story"

"Once upon a time There was a very tall 5 year old, with large eyebrows. He wore
rough-cut, reliable clothing in a very humble town. He had great aspirations, a
dream of visiting the stars and finding honor. Over the time, he gathered scar
after worn scar. The one forgiveness of this experience was learning so much of
the fauna and flora of many lands. I'm now 75 years old, but I'm still seeking
honor and am proud you chose to come with me."

The Kal-dar share some stories from their homes, and even Daw joins in.

As time passes, both Felt and Thel are in a happy stupor of food and story
telling.

### Noon, Ends at 5,4,

## Session 6 (Fifth of Ahn, Mid-Afternoon, Clear)

While Thel takes a nap, the Kal-Dar broke camp, and Daw went back to their hut
to gather some supplies.

Thel wakes up and scratches Felt, who seems warm and relaxed from the nap.

Thel heads north. The woods grow progressively darker, with the birds and
animals making their "this is mine" calls instead of their mating calls or
eating songs.

Thel chats a bit with Daw, who has been chanting in a language that Thel does
not understand.

Thel separates from the group to follow the sound of water.

Upon finding the creek, Thel stumbled upon an Ablegrik attacking a Burmut. Thel
attempts to intercede, shouting for the Kal-Dar and Daw.

The shout attracts a Dabblingwakka and two Bedarer.

Thel is injured by the Dabblingwakka, but  Daw uses their druidic magic to calm
the Bedarer. Felt scares off the Ablegrik.

Earl is able to use their knife to bring down the Dabblingwakka, but is shot
accidentally by Eye.

Daw heals the Dabblinwakka, while complaining about the brutality of Thel and
the group.

Daw teaches Thelonious the Druidic phrase, "Darra Nay, Tarra Shen" which shows
the light and dark druidic powers.

Thel retreats to their tent for the night.

### Ends at Night

## Session 7 (Sixth of Ahn, Early Morning, cloudy)

The morning. The woods are filled with the sounds of morning creatures. They
seem anxious, with higher tensions.

Thelonious chants "Darra Nay, Tarra Shen" and finds that the wind is blowing a
dark ash like substance southways, and it flows deeply through the creek.

Thel teaches Eye how to shoot arrows, in the hopes that they will stop hitting
their friends.

Thel returns to see Daw and Felt playing, tossing ancorns back and forth. Thel
thinks about how to not leave the Kal-Dar behind.

Thel tasks Ben with filling water and bringing it to Daw, who cleanses it of the
dark magic.

### End at Morning
