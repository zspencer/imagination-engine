There is a small path running north to south.

The bugs, birds and animals seem at ease; going about their lives with little
regard for you.

To the north, there is some smoke as if from smokestacks.

To the south, is a beach and the sound of the oceans waves.

To the east and west, is a calm wood, with the sound of birds and small animals
moving through the brush.
