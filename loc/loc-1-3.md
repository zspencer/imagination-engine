The woods are deep, the scents of trees and moss and the music of the birds,
beasts and insects comingle, filling the air and senses.

A skilled ranger may see there is a light foot path, not particularly obscured
running north to south.

To the south, the hint a camp-fire scent is nearby.

To the north, east and west is deep wood.
