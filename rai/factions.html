      Kal is a city with beauitful stone walls hewn from the side of a mountain
      using powerful magic. It is ruled by the
      <person ref="duke-of-kal">Duke of Kal</person>; a somewhat pompous oaf.

        Exciled from the northern city of Kal, the Kal-Dar are hungry, scared,
        and worn down. They were driven by their homes by the

        For months, they have traveled. First, heading southwest to the

        They are not particularly cunning or skillful. Most of the Kal-Dar are
        former shop-keeps and tradesfolk who were on the wrong side of an
        insurgency that got a bit more heated than intended. They lack most
        survival skills.

        They have recently been taken under the wing of
