      Kal is a city with beauitful stone walls hewn from the side of a mountain

        Exciled from the northern city of Kal, the Kal-Dar are hungry, scared,
        and worn down. They were driven by their homes by the
        <relationship nemesis ref="kal-royalists"> Kal Royalists </relationship

      </p>

      <p>
        For months, they have traveled. First, heading southwest to the
        <location ref="oon"> City of Oon</location>, then heading east along the
        southern road through the
        <location ref="fondaloon-forsest"> Fondaloon Forest </location>
        to the <location ref="del">Village of Del</location>, which they've
        resorted to raiding for food from their
        <location ref="kal-dar-camp">camp</location>.
      </p>

      <p>
        They are not particularly cunning or skillful. Most of the Kal-Dar are
        former shop-keeps and tradesfolk who were on the wrong side of an
        insurgency that got a bit more heated than intended. They lack most
        survival skills.
